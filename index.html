    <h1>Bears are awesome</h1>

    <p>Bears can be ferocious, destructive forces of nature.<img src="https://www.backpacker.com/.image/t_share/MTQ0OTE0MDgwMTgxNTkzNjY1/18694935258_cdc4efe493_k_opt.jpg">

    <p>But they can be cuddlly as well.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Grizzly_Bear_Family_in_Glacier_National_Park.jpg"></p>

    <p>My favorite fact about bears is that ancient people were very superstitious and terrified of these animals that they feared speaking its name would summon one. Bear roughly means "big brown thing."</p>
